# Women Safety Prediction

The **Women Safety Prediction** project is a machine learning and data-driven application designed to assess the safety of locations based on multiple features such as area, time, people frequency, and nearby facilities. It leverages preprocessing pipelines, resampling techniques, and classification algorithms to predict whether a given context is *Safe* or *Unsafe*.  
The project also provides a **Streamlit-based user interface** that allows users to interactively test predictions.

## Project Overview
Womenâ€™s safety is a pressing social issue, particularly in urban environments. This project applies **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to predict whether a location is safe or unsafe based on factors like:
- Area, Zone, Tier  
- Time of day  
- Presence of police stations, bars, and residential levels  
- People frequency  

The outcome is a binary prediction (*Safe / Unsafe*) that can guide awareness, research, and potential safety planning.

## Features
- **End-to-end ML pipeline**: preprocessing, resampling (SMOTE/SMOTEN), training, evaluation.  
- **Multiple models** trained and compared, with confusion matrices and metrics.  
- **Streamlit Web App** for interactive prediction.  
- **Visualization support** using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
- **Reproducible training pipeline** with serialized models.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure & Datasets

- **data/**  
  Contains cleaned and preprocessed datasets for **Chennai, Bangalore, and Karnataka**:

  1. **Chennai** â€“ Collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (public dataset containing safety-related features for Chennai).  
  2. **Bangalore & Karnataka** â€“ Custom datasets created based on **research and compilation from public sources**:  
     - **Sources:**  
       - Local police station data and crime reports from official police websites  
       - Municipal and government safety portals  
       - Publicly available maps and area information  
       - Online news reports and safety surveys  
     - The data was manually cleaned, mapped, and standardized to match the structure of the Chennai dataset.  
     - Columns include:  
       - `Area` â€“ Name of the locality  
       - `Zone` â€“ Zone or police jurisdiction  
       - `Time` â€“ Time of day categorized as Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night  
       - `People.Frequency` â€“ Low, Medium, High  
       - `Is.Police_Station` â€“ Yes / No  
       - `Is.Bar` â€“ Yes / No  
       - `Tier` â€“ Middle / Outer / Other classification  
       - `Residence.Level` â€“ Low / Medium / High  
       - `Class` â€“ Target variable: Safe / Unsafe  

  All categorical features have been **converted to numeric values** for modeling. Sample CSVs are provided for testing and demonstration purposes.
